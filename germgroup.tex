\subsection{Not every element is a commutator}
The procedure used to prove that every element is a product of two commutators 
can not be used to prove that every element is a
commutator since for equations of genus $1$ the 
genus does not increase by passing to a succeeding pair. 

In fact not every element $g\in G'$ is a commutator. This can be seen by
considering finite quotients. A commutator in the group would be also a
commutator in the quotient group. 

We will define an epimorphism to a group with commutator width $2$.

Analogously to the construction of $\psi\colon \Aut(T_n )\to \Aut(T_n) \wr S_n$
we can define a homomorphism $\psi_n\colon G \to G\wr_{2^n} \RNK{G}{\Stab(n)}$ by
mapping an element $g$ to its actions on the subtrees with root in level $n$
and the activity on th $n$-th level of the tree.

Consider the following epimorphism:
\begin{align*}
germ\colon G&\to\left<b,c,d\right>\simeq C_2\times C_2, \\
a&\mapsto 1,\\
b,c,d&\mapsto b,c,d.
\end{align*} It extends to 
an epimorphism $germ_n\colon G\wr_{2^n} \RNK{G}{\Stab(n)}\to G_0\wr_{2^n} \RNK{G}{\Stab(n)}$.
We will call the image $germ(G)=:G_0$ the $0$-th \emph{germgroup} and furthermore
$G_n := germ_n \circ \psi_n(G)$ the $n$-th \emph{germgroup}.

The $4$-th level \emph{germgroup} 
a group of order $67\,108\,864$ has commutator width $2$.
If the FR package is present this group can be constructed in GAP with 
the command 
\begin{lstlisting}
   gap> Range(EpimorphismGermGroup(GrigorchukGroup,4))
\end{lstlisting}
In this germgroup there is an element which is not a commutator 
but in the commutator subgroup. This element is part of the
precomputed data and can be used in gap with
\gapinline{PCD.nonCommutatorGermGroup4}.
