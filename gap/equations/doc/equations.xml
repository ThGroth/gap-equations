This package installs some new method for the command 
<C>FreeProduct</C>. Before it was only possible to construct
free products of finitely presented groups.

<P/> If the resulting group was constructed
by the new methods they will be in the following 
filter: <C>IsGeneralFreeProduct</C>

We fix a set <M>X</M> and call its elements <E>variables</E>.  We assume
that <M>X</M> is infinite countable, is well ordered, and its family of finite
subsets is also well ordered, by size and then lexicographic order. We
denote by <M>F_X</M> the free group on the generating set <M>X</M>.
<P/>
  Let <M>G</M> be a group. The <E>equation group</E> will
  be the free product <M>G*F_X</M> and the elements belonging 
  to <M>G</M> will be called <E>constants</E>.
<P/>
  A <M>G</M>-equation is an element <M>E</M> of the group <M>F_X*G</M>
  regarded as a reduced word. For <M>E</M> a <M>G</M>-equation, its set of
  <E>variables</E> <M>\textup{Var}(E)\subset X</M> is the set of symbols in <M>X</M>
  that occur in it; namely, <M>\textup{Var}(E)</M> is the minimal subset of <M>X</M>
  such that <M>E</M> belongs to <M>F_{\textup{Var}(E)}*G</M>.
<P/>
  An <E>evaluation</E> is a <M>G</M>-homomorphism <M>e\colon F_{X} * G \to G</M>.
  A <E>solution</E> of an equation <M>E</M> is an evaluation <M>s</M>
  satisfying <M>s(E)=1</M>. If a solution exists for <M>E</M> then the
  equation <M>E</M> is called <E>solvable</E>. The set of elements
  <M>x\in X</M> with <M>s(x)\neq 1</M> is called the <E>support</E> of the solution.
